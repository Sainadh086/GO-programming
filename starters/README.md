Go is tricky in the beginning and it follow's a unique style and bit of insipiration from the C programming language.
It supports OOPs, which is a programming paradigm that enables us to model complex systems as objects.

### Important things to know

We have  to compusory use the declared variables, imported packages, functions and structures in the program otherwise it will give an error.

Sole purpose is to use the computing power and memory efficiently.

Here we don't have Classes, but we have Objects which can be created using Structures.
GO also doesn't support while loops, but it has for loops and for can be used as while.
